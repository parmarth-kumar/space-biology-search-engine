Of course. A great project deserves a great README file.

This README is designed to be comprehensive, explaining the project's purpose, its features, the technology used, and clear instructions for how to set it up and run it.

Here is a complete `README.md` file for your project. You can copy and paste this directly into a `README.md` file in the root of your project directory.

# 🚀 Space Biology Knowledge Engine

Welcome to the Space Biology Knowledge Engine, a web application designed to explore, search, and analyze decades of NASA's space biology research. This project was built for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge**.

Our engine transforms a simple CSV list of publications into a rich, interactive, and AI-summarized database, making complex scientific discoveries more accessible to researchers, students, and enthusiasts alike.

-----

## ✨ Key Features

  * **AI-Powered Summaries:** Leverages the Google Gemini AI to read research papers and generate concise, easy-to-understand summaries, categories, and keywords.
  * **Dynamic Data Pipeline:** A powerful Node.js script scrapes publication data, processes it with AI, and builds a rich JSON database from a simple CSV source.
  * **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Instantly search through hundreds of publications by title or keyword, and filter by specific research categories.
  * **Interactive UI:** A beautiful, responsive, and modern "glassmorphism" interface with an animated starfield background for an immersive experience.
  * **Detailed Research View:** Click on any research card to open a detailed modal with the AI summary, key findings, and a direct link to the full publication on the NCBI website.
  * **Resilient Data Processing:** The data generation script is built to be robust, featuring automatic retries for temporary network errors and an API key pool to manage rate limits.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20.x or higher recommended)
  * `npm` (comes with Node.js)
  * Google Account(s) to generate Gemini API keys.

### 1\. Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/space-biology-engine.git
cd space-biology-engine
```

Install the required `npm` packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2\. Configuration (API Keys)

This project requires API keys from Google AI to power the data generation script.

1.  **Generate API Keys:** Have each team member go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) and create a free API key.

2.  **Create `.env` file:** In the root of the project, create a file named `.env`.

3.  **Add Keys:** Open the `.env` file and add your keys as a comma-separated list.

    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEYS=key_from_person_1,key_from_person_2,key_from_person_3
    ```

### 3\. Data Generation

The application's data is generated by a script that reads the `SB_publication_PMC.csv` file and processes it with AI. **You only need to do this once.**

1.  **Set the Batch Size:** Open `process-with-ai.js` and set the `BATCH_SIZE` to a number like `25`.
2.  **Run the Script:** In your terminal, run the script. It will process one batch of articles.
    ```bash
    node process-with-ai.js
    ```
3.  **Repeat:** Run the same command again. The script will automatically pick up where it left off. Repeat this process until the script outputs `✅ All articles have been processed.` This may take multiple runs over a couple of days due to API rate limits.

The final data will be saved in `src/data/ai-generated-data.json`.

### 4\. Running the Application

Once the data generation is complete, you can run the web application.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to the local URL provided (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

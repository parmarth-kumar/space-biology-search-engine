# 🚀 Space Biology Knowledge Engine

Welcome to the Space Biology Knowledge Engine, a web application designed to explore, search, and analyze decades of NASA's space biology research. This project was built for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge**.

Our engine transforms a simple CSV list of publications into a rich, interactive, and AI-summarized database, making complex scientific discoveries more accessible to researchers, students, and enthusiasts alike.

## ✨ Key Features

  * **AI-Powered Summaries:** Leverages the Google Gemini AI to read research papers and generate concise, easy-to-understand summaries, categories, and keywords.
  * **Dynamic Data Pipeline:** A powerful Node.js script scrapes publication data, processes it with AI, and builds a rich JSON database from a simple CSV source.
  * **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Instantly search through hundreds of publications by title or keyword, and filter by specific research categories.
  * **Interactive UI:** A beautiful, responsive, and modern "glassmorphism" interface with a custom-animated "space biology" background for an immersive experience.
  * **Detailed Research View:** Click on any research card to open a detailed modal with the AI summary, key findings, and a direct link to the full publication on the NCBI website.
  * **Resilient Data Processing:** The data generation script is built to be robust, featuring automatic retries for temporary server errors.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20.x or higher recommended)
  * `npm` (comes with Node.js)
  * A Google Account to generate a Gemini API key.

### 1\. Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/space-biology-engine.git
cd space-biology-engine
```

Install the required `npm` packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2\. Configuration (API Key)

This project requires a single API key from Google AI to power the data generation script.

1.  **Generate API Key:** Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) and create a free API key.

2.  **Create `.env` file:** In the root of the project, create a file named `.env`.

3.  **Add Key:** Open the `.env` file and add your key. Make sure the variable name is `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

### 3\. Data Generation

The application's data is generated by a script that reads the `SB_publication_PMC.csv` file and processes it with AI. **You only need to do this once.**

1.  **Set the Batch Size:** Open `process-with-ai.js` and set the `BATCH_SIZE` to a number like `25`.
2.  **Run the Script:** In your terminal, run the script. It will process one batch of articles.
    ```bash
    node process-with-ai.js
    ```
3.  **Repeat:** Run the same command again. The script will automatically pick up where it left off.
      * **Note:** The free tier for the Gemini API has a daily rate limit (e.g., 50 requests/day). You may need to run this script over several days to process all the articles.

The final data will be saved in `src/data/ai-generated-data.json`.

### 4\. Running the Application

Once the data generation is complete, you can run the web application.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to the local URL provided (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
